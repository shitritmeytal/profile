<h3>Production and Artistic Meneger</h3>
<p>As finishing acting school, along with my acting roles,<br>
	i started working also as a producer at one of the biggest production copany called -<br>

	which specializes in childrens intertaiment shows,<br> and done already more than 150 shows , starring the greatest children artist in Israel.<br>

<h3>Rhythmic Gymnastic Trainer</h3>
<p>It all started when i came one day to visit my friend, Yulia, at work .<br>
Introduction - Yulia and i  have known each other for many years,<br> since we preformed together at the Israeli National Theater - "HABIMA" .<br>
While i was turning my career into the production business,<br> Yulia has opened and maneged the rhytmic gymnastics club in Beer-Yaakov.<br>
After watching the girls practice it took me only 5 min' to be convinced to come and train with her.<br>
I did have a background in dance, but not in r.gymnastics, <br>so i spent the summer months sitting and studying the <a href="https://www.gymnastics.sport/publicdir/rules/files/en_RG%20CoP%202017-2020%20with%20Errata%20Dec.%2017.pdf">FIG rythmic gymnasticd rules</a>.<br>

<h3>YU ME</h3>
<p>
At 2019,while i was still training (and along with my other <span style=color:red;>love</span> for fasion),<br> Yulia and i started a new brand/lable called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Yu-Me-Fashion-for-rhythmic-gymnastic-690885454683726/ ">YU ME - fasion for rhythmic gymnastics</a>. <br>
The global training outfeet code is mostly black, however , no one said anything about borring or flat... <br>
So we eccepted the challange and 5 months later we launched our first summer collection.<br>
One of our biggest achivment was to design and produce the outfeet, <br>
of the <a href="http://www.ecacro2019.co.il/index.php?dir=site&page=gallery&op=category&cs=23" target="_blank"><b>Israely Acrobatic Team</b></a> ,for the<span class="red"> European Championship</span>, back in <i>october 2019</i>.<br>
<br>
I think that beyond the lovely desings and the uncompromising  good quality of the clothes,<br>
 what made us so special, was the fact that we produced everythig "blue and white" <img style=width:40px src="https://www.yo-yoo.co.il/coolpics/images/uploads/c8ee3b.jpg"> <br>
<br>

<span class="red">Proud to present our first collection.</span>
